                            Fate series is a TYPE-MOON media collective that follows various events called Holy Grail Wars that involve Masters, generally accomplished magi, summoning Servants, Heroic Spirits, and battling each other until the last remaining pair can claim the purported Holy Grail. 
                            It began with the visual novelWP, Fate/stay night, and has since gathered a number of prequels, sequels, spin-offs, and adaptations bearing the same "Fate" name.

                            The Fate series has several anime that have more or less the same concept, but each story has a different plot. 
                            There are several examples of very famous fate anime, including fate/zero, fate/stay night, fate/apocrypha, and fate/strange fake.

                        <p>
                            The fate series has many adaptations including a manga adaptation. This manga's story can be taken from game stories such as the manga fate/grand order and from anime stories such as fate/strang fake and many other titles. 
                            like other fate stories, these mangas have a story with the concept of a holy grail war.

                            This fate series also has several interesting game titles such as fate/grand order. 
                            Fate/grand order is a turn base RPG game. 
                            The story in this game is very interesting and this game has quite a lot of character options because this game was released in 2018. There is also a game that was recently released, namely fate/samurai remnant whose story is set in Edo era Japan.
